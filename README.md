# Matrix_Multplication on FPGA

### Overview 

This project implements a hardware-accelerated matrix multiplication module using Vitis HLS. The design is optimized for FPGA-based acceleration, leveraging High-Level Synthesis (HLS) techniques to achieve efficient computation and tested on Kria KV260 Vision AI starter Kit

### Prerequistes 

To build and run this project, you need:
- Xilinx Vitis IDE (2022.1 or later)
- Software Platform for the targeted Xilinx board (or use a default pre-built one) 
- Xilinx FPGA board (If you are flashing it on hardware).
