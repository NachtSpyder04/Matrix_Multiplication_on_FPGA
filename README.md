# Matrix_Multplication on FPGA

Hardware implementation of matrix multiplication using Verilog. The design includes a testbench to verify the correctness of the implementation.

### Prerequistes 

Ensure you have the following tools installed:
- [Icarus Verilog](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/usage/installation.html) : For compiling and simulating the Verilog code.
- [Gtkwave](https://gtkwave.github.io/gtkwave/index.html) : For viewing the waveform output.

### Running the Simulation

To compile, run, and view the simulation results, execute:
```sh
make
```
